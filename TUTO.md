# What is Docusaurus?

It's an open-source tool for building documentation websites using React and Markdown.  
It's SEO-friendly because it pre-renders your HTML pages, which enhances the search engine ratings for your website.  

Docusaurus offers very useful plugins such as: 
- translation of your docs into multiple languages
- document versioning
- very efficient content search functionality

# Why I'll be using it

The goal is to have a free online solution for hosting my personal knowledge base (markdown files).  

To achieve that, I need to:
- Put all my notes in a Git repo (GitHub/GitLab).
- Add Docusaurus to generate a documentation website with built‑in search.​
- Deploy my Docusaurus setup to GitHub Pages or Netlify for zero‑cost hosting
